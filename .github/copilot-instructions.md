# Pi-thera.one - AI Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
Pi-thera.one is an early-stage project. The name suggests a Raspberry Pi-based therapeutic or therapy-related application.

**Current State**: Initial repository setup with minimal codebase.

## Development Guidelines

### Repository Structure
- Currently minimal structure with just README.md
- As the project evolves, organize code by functional domains
- Use `.github/` for CI/CD workflows, documentation, and GitHub-specific configs

### Getting Started
This is a new project. When adding features:
1. Define the project's core purpose and technology stack first
2. Set up proper dependency management (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
3. Establish development environment setup instructions in README.md
4. Consider containerization if targeting Raspberry Pi deployment

### Coding Patterns
**To be established** - This section will be updated as project patterns emerge:
- Language(s) to be determined (likely Python for Pi projects)
- Framework preferences
- Testing approach
- Code organization conventions

### Deployment Considerations
If targeting Raspberry Pi:
- Document target Pi model and OS requirements
- Consider resource constraints (memory, CPU)
- Plan for remote deployment and updates
- Handle GPIO/hardware interfacing if applicable

### Contributing
- Keep README.md updated with project vision and setup steps
- Document architectural decisions as the project grows
- Add build/test commands to this file once established

**Note**: This is a starter template. Update these instructions as the project's architecture, patterns, and workflows become established. Focus on capturing the "why" behind design decisions and non-obvious workflows.
